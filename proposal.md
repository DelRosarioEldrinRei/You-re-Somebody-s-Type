# You’re Somebody’s Type

## Project Concept

### Statement of the Problem
The demand of blood in the Philippines is increasing at a rapid rate as time pass by due to lack of donors. Many hospitals have been experiencing blood shortage this past few years, which leads to death of millions of people every minute.

### Proposed Solution
Our app is about blood donation, wherein there are three types of user; The Admin, Blood Bank Account, and Members. Where everyone can post, if they need a blood donor or they want to donate blood. The Admin will be the one responsible mostly on the entire app. The Blood Bank Account (admin) will be the one to monitor the stocks of blood availability and the Members can post whether they are donor or beneficiaries, but they need an approval to the admin before they can post to the dashboard. This app is basically created to help the donor and beneficiaries to easily communicate with each other regarding on what they need.

### Target Users
Everyone can access our app whether you’re a donor, beneficiaries or a normal user. 

### Benefits
- To provide a platform where users can easily communicate to each other, regarding on what they searching for.

- To inform them the importance and benefits of donating blood.

- Everyone can save millions of lives in just donating their blood.
